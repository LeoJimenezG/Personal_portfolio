# Personal Portfolio ðŸ’¼ 

A personal web portfolio built using **Flask**, **BootStrap**, **Jinja2**, and templating.  

---

## ðŸ“˜ How does it work?  

This is a simple website that utilizes Flask routes and Jinja2 templating. It serves as a platform to share 
information about myself, my education, the projects Iâ€™ve worked on, and at this moment my (non-existent) work experience ðŸ˜….  

The website includes four main public routes, none of which require any credentials.  

### Routes Overview:  

- `"/"`: The landing page that introduces visitors to my portfolio.  

- `"/resume"`: Provides information about my educational background, experience and skills.  

- `"/projects"`: Showcases the main and impactful projects Iâ€™ve worked on.

- `"/contact"`: A simple part where visitors can find ways to reach out to me.

## ðŸ’¡ Notes  

- The design is based on a **BootStrap template**, which I customized to suit my portfolio.  
- I considered adding user accounts and credentials but decided it was not necessary for the purpose of this project.  


- *Extra: I was planing on using GitHub pages to host my website. However, I've realized that it only works for static 
websites. My website is dynamic and I need more things than expected in order for it to work. So, I will try to learn more
about this topic and try this task later.*
- *More extra: GitHub Actions documentation links don't work (404 error).*
